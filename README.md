# Truby Path Mapper

> **Where structure meets possibility.** Traverse John Truby’s story lattice in realtime—branch, break, and rebuild your plot until it *sings*.

## Ignition | Why this Exists

Writing feels like spelunking with one match: the moment the flame goes out, you bump a wall.  Beat spreadsheets offer light, but only in a straight tunnel.  Truby Path Mapper hands you a **holographic map**—every corridor, every locked door, every false floor—so you can race the maze instead of measuring it.

*What if the fake‑ally strikes sooner?* Click and see the ripple.  *What if revelation #3 never lands?* Erase it and watch tension collapse.  Risk‑free experimentation, structural integrity intact.

This project is for anyone who hears story logic **humming under the hood** and wants a dashboard, not a sticky note.
